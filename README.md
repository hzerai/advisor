The back end of your site is like an endless intricate system of water pipes. When there is a leak leading to a flood, good luck figuring out why.

The logs you need to sift through are constantly changing, and it’s incredibly time consuming to find the problem, learn why it happened and fix it.

These problems are costing you time, money and often customers, and as you may already know, many log solutions keep your data in silos, which slows down your investigations.
